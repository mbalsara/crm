/**
 * Better-Auth Hooks Setup
 * 
 * ⚠️ NOTE: Hooks are now configured directly in better-auth.ts using databaseHooks
 * This file is kept for reference but hooks are configured inline in betterAuth() call
 * 
 * Better-auth uses databaseHooks in the config, not auth.hooks after initialization
 * See: apps/api/src/auth/better-auth.ts for the actual hook implementation
